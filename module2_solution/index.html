	<p id="p">Chicken is the common type of poultry in the world. Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.</p>

	   <p id="section" class="color2">Beef</p>
	<p id="p">Beef is first divided into primal cuts, pieces of meat initially butchering. These are basic sections from which steaks and other subdivisions are cut. Since the animal's legs and neck muscles do the most work, they are the toughest; the meat becomes more tender as distance from hoof and horn increases.</p>

	<p id="p">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as salmon, mackerel, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. Daikon radish or pickle are popular garnishes for the dish.</p>
